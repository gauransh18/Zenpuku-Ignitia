split sentence into array of words/tokens
    a token can be a word or punctuation character, or number





    stemming = find the root form of the word
    examples:
    words = ["organize", "organizes", "organizing"]
    words = [stem(w) for w in words]
    -> ["organ", "organ", "organ"]



    return bag of words array:
    1 for each known word that exists in the sentence, 0 otherwise
    example:
    sentence = ["hello", "how", "are", "you"]
    words = ["hi", "hello", "I", "you", "bye", "thank", "cool"]
    bog   = [  0 ,    1 ,    0 ,   1 ,    0 ,    0 ,      0]
